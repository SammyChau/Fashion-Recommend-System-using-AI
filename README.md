1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The code reads a CSV file containing fashion product data and preprocesses it by dropping irrelevant columns and removing any rows with missing values.
2. Function Definitions: The code defines several functions to perform different tasks:
  - display_brand_wordcloud: Displays a word cloud of brand names based on frequency in the dataset.
  - recommend_outfits: Recommends outfits based on predefined criteria (e.g., highest rated products).
  - display_highest_rated_products: Displays the highest rated products from the dataset.
  - calculate_score: Calculates a score for each product based on its ratings and number of ratings.
  - display_recommendations: Displays recommendations based on calculated scores.
  - virtual_assistant: Main function to handle user interaction and provide menu options for different tasks.
3. User Interaction: The virtual_assistant function prompts the user to choose from a menu of options, such as displaying brand word clouds, recommending outfits, displaying highest rated products, displaying recommendations, or exiting the program.
4. Execution: The code continuously loops to allow users to interact with the virtual assistant, executing the selected tasks based on user input until the user chooses to exit.
